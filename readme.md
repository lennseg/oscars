#The Oscars: Interactive Visualization

##Spring 2017

I wanted to create a visualization from the [Academy Award Database](http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/). Itâ€™s a pretty large database so I focused on their statistics. The statistics are arranged by award category and represent 89 years of Academy Awards history through the 2016 (89th) Awards.

This visualization shows actors and actresses who have been nominated five or more times.

#The Academy Outliers: Interactive Visualization
------------------------------------------------------------
##Spring 2017

Last fall, I wanted to create a visualization from the [Academy Awards Database](http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/). Itâ€™s a pretty large database so I focused on their statistics. The statistics are arranged by award category and represent 89 years of Academy Awards history through the 2016 (89th) Awards.

This visualization shows 57 actors and actresses who have been nominated five or more times in a leading or supporting role.

The next step was to make this visualization interactive.

#Process

##Creating the Grid

Using the images from the print version, I created an unordered list in HTML and used CSS to align the images and create a hover effect as the user scrolls through the grid.

Users can sort the nominees by gender (male or female) or revert back to view all the nominees by selecting any button on top.

##Creating the Datasets

I wanted to get specific information from each nominee. Instead pulling from an API, I decided to create the datasets. Each actor has an id with their last name. The data includes their name, academy award nominations, academy award wins and genres of their entire career.

The next step was to display the data once the user clicks on a nominee in javascript. When the user clicks on an image, a window will open showing the current actor/actress' nominations, wins and genres. The user can close the window and continue to select other nominees. 

Note: This was the most challenging part of building this website.

Once the data was displayed, I was having issues resetting the window modal. Data was being added if I kept clicking though all the nominees. For example, if I selected Meryl Streep and then Jack Nicholson it would diplay both of their datas on the same window modal. 

In javascript, I removed the commas and formatted the list to show the current id for nominations. After another id was selected the list would reset.

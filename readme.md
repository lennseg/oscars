#The Academy Outliers: Interactive Visualization

##Spring 2017

Last fall, I wanted to create a visualization from the [Academy Awards Database](http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/). Itâ€™s a pretty large database so I focused on their statistics. The statistics are arranged by award category and represent 89 years of Academy Awards history through the 2016 (89th) Awards.

This visualization shows 57 actors and actresses who have been nominated five or more times.

The next step was to make this visualization interactive.
